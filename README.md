# About

This is a resource to help me learn clojure as I follow along with all the examples in Clojure for the Brave and the Bold by Daniel Higginbbotham.

I am aiming to approach this in the style of "Learn Python the Hard Way" by hand-typing each example and doing each excersize until the end of the book.

Admittedly this code is more than likely under-documented, not well packaged, structured, or well crafted code. This is my first introduction to the Clojure language.
